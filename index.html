        <h1>The Illusion of Randomness</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><em>A Philosophical Thought of My Mind - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsagarbiswas/" target="_blank">Sagar Biswas</a> (07/12/2024)</em></p>
        <p><strong>I believe that everything is pre-decided</strong>, and the concept of <strong>independent decision-making is an illusion.</strong> Every action, thought, and decision has a reason behind it—a cause rooted in the intricate web of natural laws and past events. This recursive chain of causality implies that the universe operates in a deterministic framework, leaving no room for true randomness.</p>

        <h2>We Are Not Controlling Our Decisions</h2>
        <p>Science teaches us that every event has a cause. When we make a decision, it feels as though we are exercising free will, but in reality, our choices are shaped by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>External inputs:</strong> Data fed to our brain through our six senses.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal processing:</strong> Neural computations are influenced by the architecture of our brain and encoded in our DNA.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental context:</strong> A set of pre-existing conditions that generate the sensory inputs we process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Machine learning algorithms make predictions based on input data and pre-defined rules, much like our brain processes sensory inputs. A model trained on specific data will always give the same output for the same input. Similarly, human decisions are determined by the "data" of our past experiences and the "algorithm" of our neural architecture. The reasons behind our decisions are themselves influenced by previous reasons, creating an infinite, <em>recursive chain</em>. If we could trace this chain back far enough, we would eventually reach the very origin of the universe. In this sense, everything that happens is not only interconnected but also pre-determined.</p>

        <h2>Randomness is a Myth</h2>
        <p>
            In classical mechanics, systems are predictable if all initial conditions are known (Newtonian physics). In quantum mechanics, randomness appears inherent (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle), but debates about whether quantum events are truly random or deterministic continue. This could be due to hidden variables we don’t yet understand.
        </p>

        <h2>Everything is Deterministic</h2>
        <p>
            If we had all data about the universe, its initial conditions, and the laws governing it, theoretically, everything would be predictable (as suggested by Laplace’s demon concept). In practice, the universe's complexity and the limitations of human knowledge make this impossible, which leads to the perception of randomness.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Everything is predictable. The entropy of the universe is zero. But we just don't know the source of all those things and don't have/know the whole past data that is why our information gain is not 1 but theoretically, it is possible 1. And <strong>whatever we do, nothing matters</strong> because it's pre-decided. I'm not promoting the belief in God, but just trying to say there is no randomness in nature.
